Caching in System Design: Improving Performance and Scalability
In the previous post of our series on system design, we discussed load balancing, a crucial technique for ensuring that a system remains available and responsive even under heavy load. In this third post, we will delve deeper into another important aspect of system design: caching.

Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary location, such as memory, to reduce the number of calls to the primary data source. This can significantly improve the performance and scalability of a system by reducing the load on the primary data source and reducing the response time for the end-users.

There are several different types of caching that can be used, including in-memory caching, disk caching, and distributed caching. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the system.

One of the most widely used in-memory caching is Redis and Memcached. Both are widely used and open-source. They are very fast and can handle a large amount of data.

Another important aspect of caching is cache invalidation, which is the process of removing stale data from the cache. This is essential for ensuring that the data in the cache remains accurate and up-to-date.

In the next post, we will continue our discussion of system design with a focus on database design and how to scale a database to meet the growing needs of a system.
